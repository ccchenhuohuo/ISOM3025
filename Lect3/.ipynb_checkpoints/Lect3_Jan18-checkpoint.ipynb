    "* Go over the jupyter notebook enviroment in Python programming\n",
    "* Random number generating with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the programming enviroment \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use python and jupyter notebook for case study. Also, you will do quiz using jupyter notebook in class, so I highly recommend you setting up the enviroment in advance if you haven't do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a software development environment where you can run Python code, including the examples in our course, and write your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Installing python and jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "*Download Anaconda*\n",
    "\n",
    " I suggest you to use Anaconda, which is a free Python distribution that includes all the libraries you need for this course.\n",
    "Anaconda is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. By default, it puts all files in your home directory, so you don’t need administrator (root) permission to install it, and if you have a version of Python already, Anaconda will not remove or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at https://www.anaconda.com/download. Download the installer for your system and run it. I recommend you run the installer as a normal user, not as administrator or root.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest you accept the recommended options. On Windows you have the option to install Visual Studio Code, which is an interactive environment for writing programs. You won’t need it for this book, but you might want it for other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Anaconda installs most of the packages you need, but there are a few more you have to add. Once the installation is complete, open a command window. On macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal. On Windows, open the Anaconda Prompt that should be in your Start menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command (copy and paste it if you can, to avoid typos):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install jupyter pandas sympy\n",
    "conda install beautifulsoup4 lxml html5lib\n",
    "conda install pint\n",
    "```\n",
    "To install any packages xxx in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Running Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not used Jupyter before, you can read about it at https://jupyter.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start Jupyter on macOS or Linux, open a Terminal; on Windows, open Git Bash. Use cd to “change directory” into the directory that contains the notebooks. Then launch the Jupyter notebook server:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ISOM3025\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: If you can not open jupyter notebook in cmd, try open anaconda promt and open it there. Alternative, try solution here:\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44515769/conda-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter should open a window in a browser, and you should see the list of notebooks in your repository. Click on the first notebook, and follow the instructions to run the first few “cells”. The first time you run a notebook, it might take several seconds to start, while some Python files get initialized. After that, it should run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also launch Jupyter from the Start menu on Windows, the Dock on macOS, or the Anaconda Navigator on any system. If you do that, Jupyter might start in your home directory or somewhere else in your file system, so you might have to navigate to find the directory with the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Opening your working .ipynb file\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, you can open any working file in your home directory. Or you can creat working file by click the drawdown button \"new\" on topright corner, and then click Python 3 (ipykernel).  \n"

    "* Generate numbers with statistical properties that are as close as possible to\n",

    "* $x_0$ is an initial value (seed or non-negative integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulo function, denoted by *mod*, results in the remainder of the Euclidean division\n",
    "of the first number by the second. For example, 18 mod 4 gives 2 as it is the remainder of\n",
    "the Euclidean division between the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
